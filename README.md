### 1. INTRODUCTION
A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to automate and streamline the operations of a library. It serves as a digital platform for cataloging, organizing, and managing a library's resources, including books, journals, and digital media. LMS facilitates tasks such as book circulation, user registration, and inventory management, allowing librarians to efficiently serve patrons and track library holdings. Additionally, it often includes features like search functionality, user authentication, and reporting tools to enhance the overall user experience. LMS plays a crucial role in modern libraries, optimizing resource utilization and providing a seamless interaction between library staff and users.

### 2. ABSTRACT
The Library Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to automate and streamline the operations of a library. This system empowers librarians and members with features for issuing and returning books, accessing student details, adding new books to the library inventory, and displaying available books. By leveraging modern technology, the system aims to enhance the overall efficiency and accuracy of library operations. By utilizing a user-friendly interface, the system aims to enhance the overall efficiency and accuracy of library operations.

### 3. OBJECTIVE
The primary goal of an LMS is to facilitate easy access to library resources, improve user experience, and enhance administrative tasks associated with library operations.This project simplifies the task of maintain records because of its user friendly nature.
A successful system must :-
1. Automate library operations for efficient resource management.
2. Streamline the process of borrowing and returning books.
3. Maintain accurate records of registered students.
4. Provide availability status for each book.
5. Implement robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
6. Create an intuitive user interface for a positive user experience.
7. Enable dynamic data handling through memory allocation.
8. Design the system for scalability and future enhancements.
9. Ensure data integrity and security.
10. Provide comprehensive documentation and user support.

### 4. DATA STRUCTURE USED :
Linked lists are used to maintain the list of books in the library (struct book) and the list of students who have borrowed books (struct student). This allows for dynamic addition and removal of elements, making it suitable for managing collections that may change over time.
A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. It is a dynamic data structure that can grow or shrink in size during program execution.
Advantages:
• Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, linked lists can dynamically grow or shrink in size.
• Easy Insertion and Deletion: Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list is more efficient than in an array.
• No Pre-allocation: Linked lists do not require a fixed amount of memory to be allocated in advance.
